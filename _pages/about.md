First of all, thank you so much for reading my blog! I am really excited to have built this blog as a platform to share my projects and interests with the world out there. I am inspired by so many things and hope to inspire others here too. This blog is already a project itself because I acquired some coding skills to build this site and it is a continuous project for improving my skills in that area. So don't be surprised to see changes over time. Also read about my journey of how I set up this blog in one of my first blog posts! I really want to to use this blog as a platform to show all the things I am passionate about. These are topics about learning&development, tech trends and economy, health & well-being, crafting projects, cooking recipes, Chinese culture, etc..

Last, but not least, I want to give a huge thanks to my husband Sven who inspires me daily and who sparked my interest for coding.
