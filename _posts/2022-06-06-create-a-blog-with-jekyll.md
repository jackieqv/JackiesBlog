My first post will be about my experience of how I set up this blog with Jekyll. 
Let me start here...
There are many ways to create a blog. You can use website builders like Jimdo or Wix, where you build your website in minutes using online drag and drop tools. Another very popular choice is WordPress, an online content management system (CMS), which is more complex but you basically use an editor on the graphical user interface to build it and you can add pre-built plug-ins to extend functions on your website. No programming skills needed. 
If you are looking for a easy way to implement your own blog without learning how to code, these options above are for you.

Since I am quite experienced with WordPress and other website builders and also aware of their limitations, I wanted to expand my knowledge. Thinking about how a website is created, it all boils down to the code and I wanted to learn more about it. I took the course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" on Coursera (Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) to learn the basics in web development. I highly recommend this course because the concepts are very well explained and it was the perfect mix of theory and hands-on practice!

Afterwards, I stumbled upon Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby and found the blogging theme of minimal mistakes (https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which I really liked and wanted to use as a template for my blog. Another reason why I settled for Jekyll was that it worked well with Github. I followed the documentation of how to set it up and found it so amazing to work with the command line for the installation and set up. It's like magic is happening :D

Prerequisites to get started to build your website with Jekyll and Github:
- Install Visual Studio Code (or a similar code editor)
- Create an account on Github.com for hosting your website on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>

Here are the high-level steps I took to build my website with Jekyll:
1. Decide for a Jekyll theme: This link provides https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/ different themes to chose from
2. Clone the theme from the Github repository: I used the template of <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a> and cloned it as a preconfigured theme to my own repository
3. Clone your online repository to your local folder
4. Install Ruby: Use the documentation on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/ to set up the installation
5. Configuration: Open your local folder with the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and replace the sample content with your own and configure as necessary.
6. Deployment: I used GitHub to host my site which is freely hosted on GitHub's `github.io` domain; You can also host it under your custom domain or you can use any other host provider you would like.

I think it's a wonderful first project to get into coding and there's still so much to unpack and learn. I learned the most through trial and error and searching for solutions in the world wide web.
Here are some helpful links that solved my challenges along the way: 
- https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll
- https://jekyllrb.com/
- Jekyll Forum: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/
- Stack Overflow Forum: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll

Now it's been a long post and I think it's still hard for non-technical people to follow. I might post about separate aspects in my future blog posts :)


Greetings,
